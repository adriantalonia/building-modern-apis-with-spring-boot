## Projects Overview

### 1. project-books
A Spring Boot application focused on managing books. It likely includes features such as:
- Book CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- RESTful API endpoints
- Example domain: library or book store management
- Configuration via `application.properties`

**Main folders:**
- `src/main/java/com/atrdev/projectbooks/` ‚Äî Java source code
- `src/main/resources/` ‚Äî Application properties and static resources
- `pom.xml` ‚Äî Maven build configuration

---

### 2. project-employees
A Spring Boot application for employee management. Key features may include:
- Employee CRUD operations
- RESTful API endpoints
- Example domain: HR or company employee management
- Uses `application.yml` for configuration
- Includes a sample H2 database in the `data/` folder

**Main folders:**
- `src/main/java/com/atrdev/projectemployees/` ‚Äî Java source code
- `src/main/resources/` ‚Äî Application configuration and resources
- `data/` ‚Äî Embedded H2 database files
- `pom.xml` ‚Äî Maven build configuration

---

### 3. todo-project
A Spring Boot application for managing to-do tasks. Features may include:
- Task CRUD operations
- RESTful API endpoints
- Example domain: personal or team task management
- Configuration via `application.yml`

**Main folders:**
- `src/main/java/com/atrdev/todoproject/` ‚Äî Java source code
- `src/main/resources/` ‚Äî Application configuration and resources
- `pom.xml` ‚Äî Maven build configuration

---

## Common Structure
- Each project uses Maven for build and dependency management.
- Standard Spring Boot project structure: `src/main/java`, `src/main/resources`, `src/test/java`.
- Each project is independent and can be run separately using its own `mvnw` script.

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the desired project folder (e.g., `project-books`).
2. Run the application using Maven Wrapper:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
3. Access the API endpoints as described in each project's documentation or code.

## Requirements
- Java 17 or later (recommended)
- Maven 3.6+
